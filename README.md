# Kamil-Dabrowski-CPP

Hello,

I would like to show u my code of C++. I did it for my school and it was single person project. 

I wrote this in visual studio

What we can see here. We ahve 3 parts of this project. 

1) enabling calculation on large numbers (in char array)
   - I don't use any conversion to other variables and all operations are performed on the terminal.

2) Class that allows you to perform calculations on large complex numbers

3) Class that allows you to create a two-way list,
   which will also be able to store objects representing large numbers as well as objects representing complex numbers.
   
Polish full project description You can find in this repo.
